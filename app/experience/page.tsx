        My path in tech has been shaped by curiosity, long nights of figuring things out, and the need to deliver products that actually work. I learned new tools because real projects demanded it and clients were counting on solid results. From building applications that handle real volume to solving problems no tutorial covers, each challenge sharpened how I think, how I design systems, and how I approach teamwork. Every step taught me how to turn problems into working solutions that people can trust.
