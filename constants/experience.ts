    description: `I lead the work behind our AI integrations and the customer communication ecosystem that powers our platform. My role involves shaping how data, automation, and design come together to create smooth multi channel experiences for customer support. I architect the AI driven communication systems that run across these channels, guide cross functional teams as we bring new ideas to life, and ensure that customer knowledge is organized inside secure vector databases for intelligent access. I also build and maintain the AI agents that interact with APIs and automate many of the support tasks behind the scenes, helping the platform operate reliably for large clients.`,

    description: `I built and integrated advanced AI features such as RAG and intelligent agents that can use tools to automate tasks, support decision making, and improve customer support. I also developed a modular social media integration layer that allows clients to connect channels like WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger, Instagram, and Viber directly to the platform. Along the way, I designed secure and scalable APIs with strong validation, authentication, and role based access control that meet SOC 2 and GDPR requirements. I helped architect a multi tenant infrastructure that scales smoothly while keeping each client’s data isolated and secure. To support reliability and long term maintainability, I created and maintained microservices, added caching layers, and set up background jobs that reduce response times and handle repetitive work automatically. I also built real time messaging pipelines between backend and AI components using RabbitMQ and Kafka, keeping data flowing smoothly at all times. All of this contributed to automation workflows powered by AI that helped reduce manual effort and improve how quickly customer issues are resolved.`,

    description: `During my early product work, I took ideas from rough concepts to fully deployed applications, learning how to build fast and intuitive experiences end to end. I created complete frontend applications with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, using Tailwind CSS to keep interfaces clean and accessible. I integrated APIs and external services to support real time features, and focused on performance through caching, lazy loading, and careful state management. I deployed projects on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, and GitHub Actions, gaining a full view of how products move from prototype to launch. Along the way, I developed a habit of testing ideas quickly, gathering feedback, and improving each version until it felt ready for real users.`,
